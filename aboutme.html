<p>My goal for my future  is to become a real estate agent. This is my career path, because ever since the fourth grade that idea just stuck to me, so that has been my life goal ever since. My plan is to do great in high school school so I can be on the right path to success.  My excellence in school can earn me opportunities to guide me to where I would want to be in my career. I feel highly certain I would be able to land that career path with the never stopping preservation and motivation that runs through me every single day. Classes that I see myself taking are &apos;Real Estate Pre-licensing Courses&apos; taking all the necessary classes that will ensure a pathway to the right road.</p>

<p>I have the characteristics of perseverance, determination, and non-stop working when it comes to school and volunteer hours that I feel committed to. My teacher, Mr.Anderson has told me I am very commmitted to my work, and one of the only children who come in afterschool to spend my hours finshing work way before they are due. I see highly of myself when it comes to the performance that will make an impact on my decisions for my career. My goal is to land a intership in highschool so that experience can give me a glimpse of the real estate agent community. Major accomplishments  that followed me through high school, has been &apos;High Honor Roll&apos; and &apos;High GPA Performance&apos;. I have participated in college fairs,career fairs and volunteer work over my summer break multiple times when I had the chance. I have learned that I have a positive heart and the realistic mindset to be on my career path in a few years. My goal is to take harder courses and outside of school find internships that benefit my career choice.</p> 


<p>In Conclusion, my goal in life is to become my childhood career path which is a real estate agent, with the knowledge of multiple real estate courses, and the non-stop perseveration of hard work. I really hope you enjoyed your time on my website, and I hope you come back and explore the rest of my masterpiece of a website!</p>
